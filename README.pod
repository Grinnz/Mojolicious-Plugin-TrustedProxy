      'tx.remote_address'            => $c->tx->remote_address,
      'tx.original_remote_address'   => $c->tx->original_remote_address,
      'req.url.base.scheme'          => $c->req->url->base->scheme,
      'is_trusted_source'            => $c->is_trusted_source,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::RealIP> modifies every L<Mojolicious> request transaction
to inject the real user agent IP address and HTTP scheme only when the request
comes from trusted upstream sources. You can specify multiple request headers
where trusted upstream sources define the real user agent IP address and the
real connection scheme, or disable either, and can hide the headers from the
rest of the application if needed.

Debug logging can be enabled by setting the C<MOJO_REALIP_DEBUG> environment
variable.

=head1 CONFIG

=head2 ip_headers

List of zero, one, or many HTTP headers where the real user agent IP address
will be defined by the trusted upstream sources. The first matched header is
used. An empty value will disable this and keep the original scheme value.
Default is C<['x-real-ip', 'x-forwarded-for']>.

If a header is matched in the request, then C<< tx->remote_address >> is set to
the value, and C<< tx->original_remote_address >> is set to the IP address of the
upstream source.

=head2 scheme_headers

List of zero, one, or many HTTP headers where the real user agent connection
scheme will be defined by the trusted upstream sources. The first matched header
is used. An empty value will disable this and keep the original remote address
value. Default is C<['x-ssl', 'x-forwarded-protocol']>.

This tests that the header value is "truthy" but does not contain the literal
barewords C<http>, C<off>, or C<false>. If the header contains any other
"truthy" value, then C<< req->url->base->scheme >> is set to C<https>.

=head2 trusted_sources

List of one or more IP addresses or CIDR classes that are trusted upstream
sources. (B<Warning!> An empty value will trust from all IPv4 sources!) Default
is C<['127.0.0.0/8', '10.0.0.0/8']>.

Supports all IP, CIDR, and range definition types from L<Net::CIDR::Lite>.

=head2 hide_headers

Hide all headers defined in L</ip_headers> and L</scheme_headers> from the rest
of the application when coming from trusted upstream sources. Default is C<0>
(disabled).

=head1 HELPERS

=head2 is_trusted_source

  # From Controller context
  sub get_page {
    my $c = shift;
    if ($c->is_trusted_source || $c->is_trusted_source('1.2.3.4')) {
      ...
    }
  }

Validate if an IP address is in the L</trusted_sources> list. If no argument is
provided, then this helper will first check C<< tx->original_remote_address >>
then C<< tx->remote_address >>. Returns C<1> if in the L</trusted_sources> list,
C<0> if not, or C<undef> if the IP address is invalid.
